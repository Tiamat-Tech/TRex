# TRex ðŸ¦–

TRex captures any text right into your Clipboard with magic of OCR. 

But what is OCR anyway? Imagine you have a PDF file or a Web page where you can't select the text, image with text on it, or even a YouTube video. Forget retyping it manually; with TRex, you can extract text from anywhere, and it is as easy as taking a screenshot.

TRex lives in the menu bar and available right where you need it the most:

To use TRex:
1. Invoke "Capture" either through the menu bar or with a global configurable shortcut
2. Select an area of the screen you want to extract text from, just like taking a screenshot
3. There is no third step - **extracted text is in your clipboard**

Demo:

Please note, text editing application on the right is not part of TRex, this is [Tot](https://tot.rocks). 
TRex is designed to be invisible and doesn't have any UI beyond the menu bar app and preferences. 

## Use cases
TRex can help you to copy text from:
- A PDF with non-selectable text
- A screenshot
- YouTube video
- Zoom call screen sharing
- ... and more!

If you can see it on your screen - TRex can copy it.
