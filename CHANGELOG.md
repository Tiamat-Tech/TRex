# TRex v1.9.1-BETA-1 Release Notes

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Czech Language OCR Fix
- **Fixed language code normalization**: Resolved issues with Czech (and potentially other) language recognition where language codes with underscores (`cs_CZ`) weren't being properly converted to the hyphen format (`cs-CZ`) required by Apple Vision OCR
- **Fixed engine selection**: Corrected issue where Tesseract engine was being selected even when disabled in preferences, causing fallback to incorrect engines with poor results
- **Language identifier handling**: Improved `LanguageCodeMapper.standardize()` to properly handle locale-based language codes

### Image Preprocessing
- **Enhanced text recognition accuracy**: Added automatic image preprocessing with:
  - +30% contrast enhancement
  - +10% brightness adjustment
  - +10% saturation boost
- These improvements help recognize low-contrast and light-colored text more reliably

### OCR Engine Management
- **Better engine routing**: Made `OCRManager.engines` publicly readable to allow proper engine filtering based on user preferences
- **Explicit Vision engine selection**: Ensures Apple Vision is used when Tesseract is disabled

## üîß Improvements

### Developer Experience
- **Enhanced logging**: Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the OCR pipeline, including:
  - Language selection decisions
  - Engine routing information
  - Recognition results with confidence scores
  - Alternate recognition candidates for debugging

### Code Quality
- **Removed unnecessary entitlements**: Cleaned up app entitlements file by removing unneeded permissions

## üìù Technical Details

This release primarily addresses language recognition issues that could affect users working with Czech and potentially other languages where locale-based language codes (containing underscores or region identifiers) weren't being properly standardized for the Vision framework.
